Here’s a sample `README.md` file for your project that includes setup instructions, libraries/tools used, and a brief explanation of the approach:

# Project Name

## Overview

This project includes a **Next.js** frontend and a **Django** backend, both of which are set up using **Docker** for easy deployment and development. This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the application locally, as well as details on the libraries and tools used.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed. You can download it from [Docker's official site](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Docker Compose**: Install Docker Compose if it’s not already installed. [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### Build and Run the Application

To build and run the Docker containers for both the Next.js frontend and Django backend, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the Docker images.
- Start the containers for the frontend and backend applications.

### Access the Applications

- **Django Backend**: Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to access the Django application.
- **Next.js Frontend**: Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the Next.js frontend.

### Stopping the Containers

To stop and remove the containers, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Running Database Migrations (if applicable)

If there are Django database migrations, apply them by running:

```bash
docker-compose exec django python manage.py migrate
```

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for building web applications.
- **Docker**: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

### Frontend Dependencies

- `recharts`: Library for creating charts and graphs.
- `typescript`: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.

### Backend Dependencies

- `django`: Web framework for building the backend.
- `djangorestframework`: Toolkit for building Web APIs.

## Approach and Thought Process

### Frontend

The frontend is built using **Next.js** with **TypeScript** for better development experience and type safety. **Recharts** is used for data visualization. The data is fetched from the Django backend using custom hooks and displayed using various chart components.

### Backend

The backend is developed using **Django**, focusing on providing RESTful APIs for the frontend. **Django REST framework** is used to simplify the process of building and maintaining the APIs. The backend and frontend are both containerized using Docker to streamline development and deployment.

### Docker

Docker is used to ensure a consistent development environment across different machines and to simplify deployment. Docker Compose manages the multi-container setup, allowing both the frontend and backend to be run with a single command.

## Troubleshooting

- **Logs**: Check the logs for debugging:

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```

- **Container Shell**: Access the shell of a running container:

  ```bash
  docker-compose exec <service-name> /bin/sh
  ```

  Replace `<service-name>` with `django` or `nextjs`.
